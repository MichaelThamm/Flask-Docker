Welcome, this is a repo to host a website using Python, JavaScript, HTML.

# Steps
The implementation of this website was tested using Windows OS but can be done using Linux or macOS as well since the Docker container works in any OS by using the hosts Linux kernal. However, the batch files in the root directory are intended for Windows users and to replicate them in another OS you will have to find the equivalent operations per your OS. To begin, clone this repo to a local directory.

## Hosted Locally
To host the web page locally, run [DevelopeEnvironment.bat](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/Flask-Docker/blob/main/DevelopeEnvironment.bat) and then [StartApp.bat](https://github.com/MichaelThamm/Flask-Docker/blob/main/StartApp.bat) once complete. These two batch files will create a clean developement environment by creating a virtual environment and installing dependancies. Then the app is started using Flask and a browser to the correct local port is opened which is the website.

## Hosted on the Web

# Conclusion
Using Flask to create a web application using the templates from w3schools the application serves as a good portfolio website. The use of Docker and Git to maintain the web application environment in a robust way.
